# RoleSim+:A Fast Algorithm for RoleSim Similarity Search
## Enviroment:
+ Windows 10

+ Intel Core i5-8265U@1.6GHz and 8GB RAM

+ Visual Studio C++ 2022
## Main:
(1) RoleSim+ Algorightm:
```c++
	RoleSim_Plus(vector<vector<int>>& G,int k,double beta);
```

(2) Extend RoleSim+ Algorithm by using steiner tree as shared tree:
```c++
	RoleSim_Plus_stei(vector<vector<int>>& G,int k,double beta);
```
(3) Extend RoleSim+ Algorithm by using 2D shared tree:
```c++
	RoleSim_Plus_2D(vector<vector<int>>& G,int k,double beta);
```

All real datasets come from the [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/) website.In order to better integrate with the algorithm, the graph in the real dataset has been remapped.Artificial datasets, on the other hand, are generated by computers by randomly generating numbers.
